# Encryption and Decryption GUI Project

This project provides a graphical interface to demonstrate multiple encryption and decryption algorithms using Python. Four encryption techniques are included:

- Base64 with custom key-based shifting
- Fernet (from `cryptography` package)
- Index-based encryption
- RSA encryption

### ðŸ’» GUI Versions Included

1. **Tkinter GUI for Base64-based encryption**
2. **Tkinter GUI using Fernet symmetric encryption**
3. **Tkinter GUI using RSA asymmetric encryption**
4. **Simple command-line indexing-based encryption**
5. **Comparison script to evaluate all encryption techniques (`best.py`)**
